Protoporphyrinogen IX oxidase (PPO) is the last common enzyme in chlorophyll and heme biosynthesis pathways. In human, point mutations on PPO are responsible for the dominantly inherited disorder disease, Variegate Porphyria (VP). Of the VP-causing mutation site, the Arg59 is by far the most prevalent VP mutation residue identified. Multiple sequences alignment of PPOs shows that the Arg59 of human PPO (hPPO) is not conserved, and experiments have shown that the equivalent residues in PPO from various species are essential for enzymatic activity. In this work, it was proposed that the Arg59 performs its function by forming a hydrogen-bonding (HB) network around it in hPPO, and we investigated the role of the HB network via site-directed mutagenesis, enzymatic kinetics and computational studies. We found the integrity of the HB network around Arg59 is important for enzyme activity. The HB network maintains the substrate binding chamber by holding the side chain of Arg59, while it stabilizes the micro-environment of the isoalloxazine ring of FAD, which is favorable for the substrate-FAD interaction. Our result provides a new insight to understanding the relationship between the structure and function for hPPO that non-conserved residues can form a conserved element to maintain the function of protein.
