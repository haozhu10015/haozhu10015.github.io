Recently, reinforcement learning and inverse reinforcement learning methods have been recognized as a useful tool for the research of this topic.
In this talk we discuss how these tools can be applied to answer the following questions:
How do we explain goal-directed animal behavior given that we often see objectively nonoptimal behavior, which factors contribute, and what are the animals optimizing for?
