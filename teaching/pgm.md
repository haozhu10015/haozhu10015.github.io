## Prerequisites

Good knowledge of linear algebra and probability. Exposure to graph theory, optimization, and reinforcement learning helpful but not required.

## Objectives

* to present the basic theory of probabilistic modeling
* to give students the training on the logic of probabilistic modeling
* to give students the tools to solve machine learning problems with probabilistic graphical models
* to give students the background required to adapt the methods in their own research work or applications
