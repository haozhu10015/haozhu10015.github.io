This page was created for posting (or really, archiving) some useful material for the course `Probabilistic Graphical Models' developed and taught by Prof. Joschka Boedecker and me in 2024.
I might still help with the teaching of this course from time to time but I am no longer on the responsible person list anymore.

Some material might be updated and additional topics might be introduced in the later semesters.
It is possible that neither of them is included on this page.

== Catalog description

The lecture deals with methods of Probabilistic Graphical Models that constitute an important class of machine learning algorithms.
